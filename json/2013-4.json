          "description": "Every 30 years, a new princess is chosen from the Hime family to serve the Hayagami. The time has come again, but over these past years, records state not a single female has been born, save for one, the 15-year-old Arata. The only problem is, Arata is actually a male! Forced to disguise himself and take the place of the princess candidate until a formal one can be found, he attends the festival only to witness the current princess, Kokuri-hime, murdered, and his own life is forfeit as well, by the hands of the princess' personal guard, the 12 Shinshou. As he runs for his life, Kannagi of the 12 convinces everyone that Arata is the one who has murdered the princess instead, and now everyone in the Imperial Court is after his head!\n",

The adorable boys of Hetalia are back with some new friends and a super sparkly new look.<br>\n<br>\nWhat’s more fun than Germany squatting in a dandelion patch? How about the Axis Boys joining the witchcraft club? Or maybe Russia suffering through a traumatic hamster flashback? Any way you slice the spaghetti, every cute boy enjoys a little quality bath time, and Turkey and Greece can’t wait to start splishing and splashing! Fall in love with this new and improved, sparklelicious season of Hetalia as Belgium throws a mouthwatering waffle party, and America shows off his sweet dance moves! We swear you won’t be disappointed – even when Santa Claus goes missing and Canada (who’s that?) tries to replace him with a polar bear! A POLAR BEAR!? Hetalia, you so cray cray. We’ve missed the squee outta ya!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Funimation)",

For Hayate Ayasaki, however, fighting off teenage heiress Nagi Sanzenin's would-be kidnappers is as much a part of butlering as serving the tea. Nor is that the only dangerous activity that Hayate's bound to be asked to perform during the course of the average day. Need to nurse everyone through an illness? Then that's part of Hayate's job description. Got an embarrassing video that has to be retrieved before it hits the internet or need help returning stolen money? Hayate's your manservant! However, as competent as Hayate may seem, there's one thing he's not particularly good at: noticing when pretty girls are attracted to him. Which is probably a good thing, as otherwise the silverware might never get polished!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

However, the competition between the individual candidates, as well as the remaining 75th and 76th generation understudies, is about to get even rougher.

Will the revelation of the source of the Kiraras prove to be a deadly misstep in the intricate choreography that’s allowed the team to keep dancing out of danger? Will public opinion prove to be more important than actual skill and valor as the squad undergoes a series of grueling trials by fan?<br\n><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
