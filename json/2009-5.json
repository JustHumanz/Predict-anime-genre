Not complex enough? Natsuru's school has separate sections for boys and girls, so he and she are now double enrolled. The rumor-mill has it that he's dating herself. And there are other Kampfers attending the school who want to take her out, and he's not sure which ones mean \"on a date\" and which ones mean \"permanently.\" Oh, and did we mention that some Kampfers use swords and gun?! Hormones, fists, and other body parts will fly as the daring, new gender-blender defender must become a contender or die! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Because of non-stop environmental destruction, the United Nations commissions a private company, \"Eternal Earth\", to create an artificial jungle, to be a nature preserve and to protect animals. All wild animals are forced to live in it.<br><br>\nThe animals that live in this \"neo-jungle\" have an easy life. Leo, son of Panja, is born in this artificial world. Because of the unrealistic nature of the neo-jungle, Leo lives his life like he hasn't a care in the world. But Leo is ridiculed by the other animals; they call him a coward--he is not like his father, the great Jungle Emperor, but Leo vows that some day he will be.<br><br>\nKenichi, son of the Eternal Earth company's CEO, has no doubt about the great success of the neo-jungle. The story starts when Leo and Kenichi meet. Kenichi has the special ability to understand what the animals are saying. <br><br>\n(Source: kimbawlion.com/2009.htm)",
