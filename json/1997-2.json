Zombies, vampires, werewolves - all of them compete in contests of strength and sheer will to attain their own personal goals. <br><br>\nAll of this becomes moot when a race of Aztec robots called the Huitzil decide that humanity isn't worth saving, and start waging war on the world, while in the sky, a solar god from outer space plots the conquest of Earth. And the Darkstalkers must become unwilling allies in order to save the world. <br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

The school has the prophecy-chosen members of the Holy Student Council to protect it. These students have problems of their own; Haruto Houjo, the president, has a way of summoning spirits, and would resign from his duty for a normal life if it weren't for the principal. Kazumi Ryodo, the next member, is good at being possessed and has something for the Hanako. The last member is Mutsuki Asahina, who is a master of exorcism and is attracted to small boys. Unfortunately, these three are in charge of keeping the school in line and defending the world from supernatural beings, and this mission brings them through wacky predicaments.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

To utter the name for which it stands is forbidden, for people were so afraid of the wrath of the god that they considered his name a curse.

He ends up making the acquaintance of a young girl named Ohri, who turns out to be quite adept in magic.<br><br>\nMeanwhile, the head of the order has hired a dark elf named, Suzu, to track down Oliver and bring him back.
