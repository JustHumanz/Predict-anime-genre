Another power, the evil dragon Daganzord, also resides on the continent, and no one is powerful enough to stop him from spreading destruction and charred land in his wake. Two individuals, Bairo and Kismitete, undertook a ritual alongside a party of wizards to seal Daganzord, but were foiled. This event was known thereafter as the Balbagoa Tragedy. Bairo and Kismitete's son Hiiro is saved by Giiru, and Hiiro swears to avenge his parents' deaths and trains himself with the sword. When Hiiro turns 16, he sets out on a journey to slay the dragon, and Giruu accompanies him, having no choice. Along the way, they meet many types of people, and gain companions on their journey.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Most of Earth has been contaminated and is collapsing into ruin, and a great majority of plants and animals are now extinct. The world heads to the “Big Six,” the sixth mass extinction event. Humanity built cities in the sky, migrating the endangered species of animals and plants there. Over many years, the animals evolved in these isolated cities. With artificial genetic crossbreeding, they acquire language, bipedality, and build a life and civilization for themselves free from want. No one thinks of the world below any longer. One day, a single plant seed wanders into one of the sky cities and some children discover it. Unable to resist the temptation to look into the world outside, they decide to undertake an adventure to the outside world, unknowing that once they set foot on the ground, they will never be able to return.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)\n<br>\n<br>\nUtopa is one of four Anime Tamago 2016 young animator training projects.",

Or, on the other end of the spectrum, you may be left only leftovers. In this type of battlefield atmosphere, students are always doing their best to “evolve” and survive. “Learning Types” are students who have studied hard their whole lives and legitimately memorized everything they have studied, while “Cheating types” are those who, as the name suggests, only managed to climb the educational ladder by cheating. Though sometimes they must cooperate with each other, there is a great rivalry between the two types. How will the hero “Mumei”, a C Type, followed by the heroin “Koi” a L-Type, struggle in those tests. Now a new battle, one beyond imagination, is about to begin.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Emon)",
