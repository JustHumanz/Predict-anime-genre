From ancient times, these 12 divine messengers have protected the land of the rising sun. They are powerful beings who have survived through \"ETM 12,\" a divine tournament held every sixty years, and admired by all Eto-musumes.<br>\n<br>\nFast forward to now, the present day, and the year ETM 12 will be held. From all over Japan, Eto-shin candidates, or in other words, Eto-musumes gather in great numbers.<br>\n<br>\nWithin that group exists a single cat Eto-musume.<br>\n<br>\nHer name is Nya-tan. She is thought of as the one closest to becoming an Eto-shin, but is a misfortunate girl who always ends up undermined by evil rodents.<br>\n<br>\nThe only way to become the 12 zodiac signs is to beat all the Eto-shins. However, the power of the Eto-shins is so great, and no Eto-musume has ever won in the tournament for the past two thousand years.<br>\n<br>\nWhen Nya-tan meets an ordinary high school boy, Takeru Amato, the story begins!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

To keep herself occupied in that big empty space, Ryou practices her cooking, something that she thought she excelled at… but nothing ever seems quite right anymore. There’s something missing, but what could it be?<br>\n<br>\nThe answer unexpectedly arrives with her runaway cousin Kirin, who’s looking for a place to stay while she attends cram school. Much to Ryou’s surprise, her cooking seems to improve when they eat together! Food, it turns out, always seems tastier when it’s made for and shared with people you care about, and things only get more appetizing when Ryou’s friend Shiina joins in the culinary adventures!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

They are also completely cut off from the outside world, keeping them sheltered and innocent. However, a problem has come up recently—more and more graduates are failing to cope with the modern world after graduation. To deal with this problem, they've decided to kidnap a male commoner student, and enroll him as a student. They hope that this will be a gentle way to introduce the girls to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagurazaka Kimito is chosen for this dubious honor, mostly because he seems utterly average. However, the school leaders also seem to have concluded he's a homosexual with a muscle fetish. When Kimito hears that the alternative may be castration (to protect the girls' purity), he eagerly plays along with this misconception. Now he'll just have to survive the attention of many high class young ladies that are completely out of touch with the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

What if all the superhumans ever written about in fictional stories existed at the same time? Superhumans who came into existence through different circumstances, and who are special in different ways -- Titans from outer space, lifeforms from a mystical world, phantoms and goblins from ancient times, cyborgs created by scientists, relics that rose out of the ruins of ancient civilizations, and the list goes on. One segment of these superhumans makes no secret of their existence and has gained popularity in society. Others cloak their identities and fight in secrecy.<br>\n<br>\nThere are enemies of superhumans as well, organizations that operate in the shadows.<br>\n<br>\nThe Japanese government has taken many measures to secure peace and order.<br>\n<br>\nOne is the establishment of an organization under the Ministry of Health and Welfare -- the Overpopulation Research Laboratory, a.k.a. the Superhuman Bureau.<br>\n<br>\nTheir mission is to identify and approach superhumans, then oversee and safeguard them. One member of the Superhuman Bureau, Jiro Hitoyoshi, is protagonist of this series.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Official Site)",
