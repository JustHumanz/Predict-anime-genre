The Human race led four other races: the brave warriors, the intelligent magicians, the agile archers and the sly thieves in a fight against the Zakums. In the end, the World Tree activated self-destruction to protect itself. However, the other races thought it was the Human race that destroyed the World Tree. When the World Tree was destroyed most of the races had nothing left, so a number of them went to Maple Island thinking the ones who stayed would die. They escaped Victoria and lived on Maple Island where living is getting harder and harder. Since then, a never-ending war between the different races began.<br><br>\nTen years later, the main protagonist, Al, is determined to revive the World Tree. Al and his companions begin their journey to seek the seeds of the World Tree. At the same time, the Zakums reappear&hellip;<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "There were three people who killed merely over differences in religion. One day the three believers who lost a mosque and icons through war no longer understood who belonged to which religion, and lost their reasons to fight. At that time, one statue rose in the center of town. Although the town thought it had regained peace by building the statue unrelated to any nation…\n<br><br>\nThe title of this work that uses the Bosnian conflict as a motif is a golden Bruce Lee image. It is said that the image was built in the center of commerce in post-war Sarajevo. The reason the statue’s creator says the following is to communicate to the public on “faithfulness, friendship, and justice”, which do not belong to any religion, “Lee is a true world hero and is a hero of all the races of Bosnia”. If war is seen from the outside, it may seem ridiculously foolish. However, since the people within are very desperate, circumstances make them want to cling on to whatever they can – this makes me feel like running away. The scenes projected here are facts that I draw – I am non-religious and someone who is not directly involved with the dispute. Distinction of different religious believers is not included and there is also no telling which country is being attacked. However, intense bombardment scenes that we often see on television are not viewable either, only the misery and humor of mere war is visible here.\n<br><br>\n(Source:  alimo.work)",
