In order to save the Fairytale World, the Queen sends three magic animals, Sei, Dai, and Ryoku, to the human world with magic gems to find three girls who can become the \"Super Miracle Idols,\" the princesses Snow White, Cinderella, and Kaguya-hime. Those \"princesses\" end up being three little girls: Yukimori Ringo, Takashiro Layla, and Sasahara Natsuki. But the gems transform them into older singing superstars, and after their accidental debut at the singer Wish's concert, they become known as \"Little Princesses,\" or \"LilPri.\" Now they must collect Happiness Tones from humans in order to restore the Fairytale World.

Ten years in the making and entirely, single-handedly rendered in colored pencil, Kurosaka's fantastical labor of love is a marvel to behold. Emerging from the staggering detail and craft flooding every frame is the story of a young woman who sets out to engineer a dream-food that can put an end to the world's famine. Synthesizing Frederic Back's subtle, haptic textures with Bill Plympton's frenetic mutations and David Lynch's haunting wormholes, Kurosaka&rsquo;s work still retains its own singular, luminous potency.<br><br>\n(Source: Los Angeles Animation Festival summary)",
