One of the most powerful espers on the planet, Hyoubu's incredible range of abilities extends as far as controlling his own aging process, and the potential strength of all his talents combined is so terrifying that he wears a device that limits their use except in cases of extreme emergency.  The time is coming, however, when Hyoubu will need to unleash everything he has.

For Sasami Tsukuyomi, who's attempting to pass her first year of high school despite being a shut in, it's more than just a word. Fortunately though, she lives with her older brother Kamiomi, who just happens to be a teacher at the school Sasami is supposed to attend. Not to mention, her \"Brother Surveillance Tool\" which lets her view the outside world via her computer and will, theoretically, allow her to readjust to interfacing with people again. What it mainly does, however, is let her view her brother's interactions with the three very odd Yagami sisters, who inexplicably seem to have had their ages reversed and have various types of \"interest\" in Kamiomi. And then things start to get really weird... Magical powers? Everything turning into chocolate? Is life via the web warping Sasami's brain, or is it the universe that's going crazy?<br><br>\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Each, living their own lives, has been given a single order: protect Sacrist S. As a completed relic, it is of upmost importance to both Irregular Threat Response and the American Federal Institute of Sacrists, and now, the wielders must escort it to the American military base in Iwakuni. The operation should have gone smoothly with both sides now cooperating. But a dark storm during the night hid a new threat until it was almost too late: the Noise. And with the doors of Babylon's treasury thrown wide, they have only increased in number. But then, amidst the rising dissonance of a destruction brought on by the Noise's alien anatomy, a girl's voice raised in song thunders out, as though piercing through them. \"This is my Gungnir!\" The cry of the first known human to fuse with a relic, Hibiki Tachibana.<br>\n<br>\nThe Noise flooding in, their movements orchestrated. The specter of the one pulling their strings looming above them. And then, the songs. The curtain rises on a new clash between mere melodies, and songs through which these girls' blood flows.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",

Unfortunately, half-human criminals means non-human clues that often leave the police stumped. That's where lone wolf detectives like Hiroshi Inaba come in. He's literally part wolf and has the amazing ability to extract critical information just by examining or tasting a sample of someone's hair! Of course, that ability has also resulted in Inaba having a little bit of a hair fetish, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for his two assistants. (Well, at least the cross-dressing one isn't complaining much.) And it's nothing compared to the strange tastes of Inaba's nemesis, the omnivorous (and half goat) crime boss Don Valentino, who has an appetite for green legal tender instead of tender young greens! Inaba's sworn to cut Valentino out of the criminal flock before the Don can wolf down more ill-gotten dough, but he's going to have to chew his way through a lot of evidence to get his goat. Can sheer dogged detective work put the baaaaad guys behind bars?<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

One day, the girls are suddenly attacked by a mysterious organization. The organization was after the \"Galileo Tesoro\" which Galileo Galilei was said to have discovered. Still unaware of what was going on, the sisters escape on the airship they built after the sudden attack. But it won't be so easy for these three sisters to help each other out in a pinch when they're constantly at odds with each other. What is the Tesoro, and what is the organization after? And what about the relationship between the sisters? It's a threesome of cute girls, action, and mystery!\r\n<br><br>\r\n(Source: Fuji Creative)",
