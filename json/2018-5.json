Here includes protagonists with the most random names in history — the mild-mannered Beryl (Green) and the easily-embarrassed Sapphire (Blue). At times the closest of friends, at others the worst of enemies… In this donghua where each episode is set in a different world, how would they encounter each other time and again? ? Only angst? Too painful! Nothing but fluff? Too sugary! Come watch B&S, the show where you'll never guess the ending…",

          "description": "The story opens on a couple-- an energetic blonde girl and a somewhat air-headed brunet boy-- in the midst of their relationship. The pair go on dates, hang out together, and get into lover's quarrels, with both the boy and the girl having their uncool or secretive qualities. Though they continue to have their ups and downs, and they have little interests in common, the girl hopes throughout the song that their relationship can stay romantic even as they get older and their family expands.<br></br>\n\nOne day, the girl leaves a kiss on her sleeping boyfriend's cheek, and later wakes up to find that he's put an engagement ring on her finger. They soon get married, and go on to have a happy life together with their new daughter, although another one soon joins them.<br></br>\n\n(Source: Confession Executive Committee Wiki)",

Taking place sometime after Raimon's victory in the Football Frontier, in this alternative universe, the alien attack from the second season never occurs. Japanese soccer has been deemed weak compared to international competition. Due to this, the Raimon Eleven have been disbanded, and its members are sent to different soccer teams across Japan in the hopes of strengthening Japan's soccer at a national level. Moreover, in the modern world of Japanese youth soccer, sponsorship has become a vital aspect of a team's survival. A youth team must have a sponsor, otherwise, their club will face disbandment, and are not permitted to partake in matches.<br><br>\n\nThe series focuses on the forward Asuto Inamori and his team, Inakuni Raimon, which is made up of players from the remote Inakunijima Island. They have replaced the original Raimon Eleven as Raimon Junior High's soccer team, and are competing as underdogs in the annual Football Frontier youth tournament.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Wikpedia)",
