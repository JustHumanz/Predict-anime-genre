One day he finds a book in the library about how to summon witches. He tries it as a joke, but it turns out to be the real thing. An apprentice witch named Rurumo appears to grant him a wish. Shibaki helps Rurumo and she in return refuses to take his soul. (This part of this story happened before the start of chapter1) When the story starts, Shibaki wishes he could see Rurumo again. His wishes is granted immediately as Rurumo falls from the sky and crash lands in front of him. He finds out that as punishment for not taking his soul she's been busted down to an apprentice demon. Now, she must complete the task of getting Shibaki to use up 666 magic tickets that grant wishes before she can become a witch again. However, what she doesn't know is that each time he uses a ticket it shortens his life. When the last ticket is used up, Shibaki will die. Shibaki knows this because Rurumo's familiar black cat Chiro tell him as part of the \"contract\" for giving him the tickets. Now, Shibaki has a choice, make a wish and help Rurumo become a witch again or resist the temptation and try to save his own life.\r\n\r\n(Source: jCafe24)",

Traveling to Tanegashima, Daichi quickly finds himself involved with the machinations of Globe, a secret agency created to defend mankind from extraterrestrial forces. And while it might seem like a big job for a mere teenager, it turns out that the skills Daichi has honed on video games, combined with a special weapon called the Livlaster, make Daichi ideally suited for operating the Earth Engine Impacter, a giant robot that may be Mankind's best hope against aliens whose goal is to completely drain our world's lifeforce energy. Fortunately, Daichi won't be on his own, as he's quickly joined by a group of equally dedicated young people who all have their own skills and abilities to contribute to the battle.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Patton famously said, “can only be led from the front end.” However, once the heat of battle has cooled and the fog of war turns as thick as minestrone, determining which end was front and who pulled on what can be difficult. Therefore, for the enthusiasts who’ve puzzled over the epic tank battle between the girls of Oorai Girls’ Academy and their Italian-themed rivals from Anzio High School, we present these classified videos for your eyes-only! Miho and Team Oorai will have their hands full with the impulsive attacks of Vice-Commander Pepperoni and facing the raw fury of Vice-Commander Carpaccio… but the real question is whether they can hold off Anchovy’s ultra-secret secret weapons! Will they persevere? Or will their opponents end up saying “tank” you very much…<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
