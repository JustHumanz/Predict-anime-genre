However, despite those restrictions, Marika Katou has proven herself worthy of commanding the Bentenmaru. And if staging performances such as pretending to board and pillage space cruise ships doesn't pay as well as actually stealing stuff… well, at least no one gets hurt, right? But things take a sinister turn when Marika and her crew are hired to raid the luxury liner Begin The Beguine. Because one of the passengers has a hidden secret and agenda of his own. And it begins with being kidnapped! Suddenly the Bentenmaru and their new \"hostage\" are being pursued by other warships and the race is on for what could be the biggest prize of all!\n<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks))",

          "description": "The gateway to Idol stardom might have opened for the newly formed singing group Wake Up, Girls, but the path to fame is full of perils and pitfalls. And for Mayu, Airi, Minami, Yoshino, Nanami, Kaya and Miyu, it's going to be especially difficult knowing who to trust, as their manager Matsuda's lack of experience could give other, less scrupulous, individuals a chance to take advantage.<br>\n<br>\nThat's a situation that quickly comes to a head when Green Leaves' president suddenly disappears with most of the money, and things only get worse when the replacement producer seems more interested in getting the girls into revealing swimsuits than promoting their music.<br>\n<br>\nAs malicious gossip begins to surface regarding Mayu's past membership in a rival group, and internal tensions begin to tear the team apart, they'll need more than just ambition to survive. Singing may be a business, but friendship and a love of music is what will keep everything together.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

But on their first day of high school, they're stunned to learn that the new seating plan has them on opposite sides of the classroom! So, since everyone knows that long distance relationships won't work unless the parties involved put extra effort into it, they decide they need to do something extra special to permanently seal their friendship. However, deciding to kiss each other awakens a whole new level of feelings, and it doesn't help that some of their classmates seem to be 'involved\" in similar circumstances. So what's a girl to do when her best girl friend suddenly seems more like a girlfriend? It's a life lesson that the school curriculum isn't normally prepared to teach, except maybe in French class, and our two young heroines are about to get a private education you'll never forget!<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
