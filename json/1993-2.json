Hazuma, an ex-cop who now runs his own detective agency, is hired to track down a missing scientist alleged to have made off with cybernetics from Professor Tani's laboratory. The missing hardware is reappearing as psycho-activated weapons grafted onto the bodies of the rogue \"cyper-junkies.\" During his investigation Hazuma is brutally murdered. Dr. Tani uses Hazuma as a bio-template to replace the missing 8 Man. As a cover, 8 Man maintains the original persona of the detective, yet must cope with the duality of the cynical private eye and maintain the balance as an emotionless super-android hero.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

The competition is very popular. However, its main support comes from the Dark Organization, a group that produces cheating Iron Leaguers that use dirty and violent tactics in games as a sure ticket for fame and popularity. While the sports community has been turned into a dangerous and (figuratively) bloody contest, Silver Castle, the team with the lowest winning ratio, tries to preserve true sportsmanship by playing sports by their original rules without any cheating or violence. The team's fate as well as the fate of the Iron League itself is changed when two Iron Leaguers - Mach Windy, Dark Prince FC's former ace striker and Magnum Ace, a mysterious but skillful baseball-playing Leaguer - join Silver Castle, and gradually lead the team back to its forgotten glory. It's not all fun and games, however; as the story goes on, it is revealed that the Iron League is actually a front for something far more sinister...\n<br><br>(Source: TV Tropes)",

          "description": "It is the dawn of the 21st century. Mankind has terraformed and colonized Mars. But we are not alone in the universe. An ancient race of alien beings, known only as `The Gods`, has been watching mankind`s progress...and waiting. Now, these mysterious aliens have returned to halt mankind`s expansion into space...by force.<br><br>\nNow, the planet named after the God of War will become our final battlefield, as mankind fights a desperate battle with the latest in high-tech, military hardware: hyper-advanced aircraft, orbital fighters, and gigantic, desert battleships brimming with the most advanced weaponry.<br><br>\nBut will it be enough? The aliens have awesome, incredibly destructive weapons at their disposal - including `Hell` - an unstoppable stealth carrier. But the alien`s primary weapon is insidiously quiet and invisible - a mind control plaque. Incurable. Inevitable. Contagious. Humans are powerless to resist its effects, which transforms even the most loyal soldiers into dangerous subversives.<br><br>\nOur last hope lies with Captain Akuh and the crew of the Battleship Aoba. If his top-secret mission is successful, mankind will deal a decisive blow to the alien armada. But Akuh`s girlfriend is showing signs of nymphomania - the first symptom of alien subversion!<br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",
