However, not all students are overachievers, and for those like Yuki Ojima, groups like the Food Research Club are welcome havens in which to slack-off. But what's a slacker to do when the radical new candidate for Student Council president announces her intent to get rid of clubs like the FRC? Well, getting the help of the current Student Council president is a good start, but HIS suggestion is so counter-intuitive that it's crazy: Yuki should run for the Student Council himself? And yet, it's SO crazy that it just might work! Especially when Chisato, the chocolate-adverse president of the FRC (and Yuki's best childhood friend,) and members of other targeted school clubs start to join the swelling FRC army. But can this army of goofs and goof-offs coast all the way to political victory? Or will someone have to step up to the plate and take one for the term? <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Meanwhile, his kid brother Hibito has been literally riding a rocket and training to be an astronaut. The same career Mutta once dreamed of. So, is it ever too late to go after your dreams? Through a little coercing and a bit of covert activity, Mutta's family and friends can get his resume on the right desk, but from that point on it will be up to Mutta himself. Does he have what it takes to turn his life around and put his footprint on the moon? The first step on the highway to the stars is always the hardest, and in a job where crash and burn isn't just a euphemism, it will be the biggest risk Mutta's ever taken. But with the best support team ever, maybe he'll find what he needs to rekindle the spark inside him and light the biggest candle of them all! <br><br>\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Well, two other boys and Haru, who claims that he's an alien. Not that constantly stewing Natsuki or mysterious Akira are any more likely as prospects for good companionship. <br><br>\nBut there's something about fishing that makes it unlike any other pastime, and maybe that quiet sense of companionship and hopeful expectation is just what Yuki needs to start charting the unfamiliar waters of personal connections.  Or maybe it will turn out that Haru's right and they're going to have to save the entire planet. <br><br>\nThere are lots of different kinds of fish stories, from the \"ones that got away\" to the \"best catches ever,\" but whichever way the currents of life take them, for four young men, this trip may turn out to be the biggest whopper ever! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

In an attempt to combat the opposition's overwhelming pressure and put an end to the massive casualties, the army forms a special unit called Wyvern, or W-0, composed of former Japanese citizens referred to as \"Elevens.\" Recruited from ghettos, these young men and women pilot Knightmare frames—humanoid war machines—into dangerous operations where death awaits, hoping to make a name for themselves.\n<br><br>\nWhen a European regiment attempting to recapture a crucial city is pinned down by the enemy, it's up to W-0 to bail them out. Among those selected for the rescue operation is Lieutenant Akito Hyuuga, known as \"Hannibal's Ghost\" due to his prowess on the battlefield. However, the supposed rescue mission becomes suicidal when, in an attempt to take out as many Britannians as possible, the commanding officer initiates the Knightmare's self-destruct sequence. In its aftermath, Akito finds that he is the last one standing…\n<br><br>\n(Source: MAL rewrite)",

The most unique trait of this prestigious \"family\" is their mastery of the Arcana - mystical powers derived from tarot cards. The current leader of the Arcana Famiglia, Mondo, wishes to choose a successor through a tournament called the Arcana Duello, and as added incentive, the winner will take the hand of Mondo's daughter, Felicita. However, two young men among the family - impetuous Liberta and serious-minded Nova - are more interested in protecting Felicita's freedom than letting her be someone's trophy wife. Together, Liberta, Nova and Felicita get to know each other better ... but with Felicita's ability to read minds, she may discover more than she bargained for in Liberta's violent past and Nova's troubled family history. Can the trio remain friends, or will the growing tension between them be too much to bear?<br><br>\n(Source: ANN Review by Carlo Santos)",
