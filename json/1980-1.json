But he gets his comeuppance when the pint-sized tomte casts a spell to make Nils just as tiny as him! The only way to break the spell is to go on a journey to distant Lapland with Morten the farm goose, Carrot the hamster, and a flock of wild geese.<br>\n<br>\nAlong the way, he contends with cruel witches, talking statues, wise ravens, and one very persistent fox. Under the guidance of the stern but caring Captain Akka, leader of the flock, Nils discovers his kind heart and his love for nature. But when the time comes, will he be able to choose between his human family and his feathered friends?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",

He must contend with students who spy on him and pull nasty stunts and with a landlord who constantly tries to sell him worthless antiques. While on a fishing trip to boost his spirits, Botchan suspects Hotta, his one friend in the village, as the cause of all of his misery.
