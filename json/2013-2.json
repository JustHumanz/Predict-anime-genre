However, three new employees are about to discover what really happens behind the scenes. Lucy Yamagami, bent on revenge against the civil servant who allowed her comically long name to be put on her birth certificate; Yutaka Hasebe, an easygoing guy always on the lookout for a place to slack off; and Saya Miyoshi, a nervous first-time worker, are about to experience the underwhelming satisfaction of being government employees.<br>\n<br>\nThey are supposed to be trained by Taishi Ichimiya, but he has no idea how to do so, even though he has worked there for eight years. With an incompetent senior colleague and unfavorable confrontations with clients, the trio starts to lose faith in their chosen occupation but encourage each other to do their best.\n",

Each, living their own lives, has been given a single order: protect Sacrist S. As a completed relic, it is of upmost importance to both Irregular Threat Response and the American Federal Institute of Sacrists, and now, the wielders must escort it to the American military base in Iwakuni. The operation should have gone smoothly with both sides now cooperating. But a dark storm during the night hid a new threat until it was almost too late: the Noise. And with the doors of Babylon's treasury thrown wide, they have only increased in number. But then, amidst the rising dissonance of a destruction brought on by the Noise's alien anatomy, a girl's voice raised in song thunders out, as though piercing through them. \"This is my Gungnir!\" The cry of the first known human to fuse with a relic, Hibiki Tachibana.<br>\n<br>\nThe Noise flooding in, their movements orchestrated. The specter of the one pulling their strings looming above them. And then, the songs. The curtain rises on a new clash between mere melodies, and songs through which these girls' blood flows.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",

When she's not attending her first year of high school, she even invents new flavors and varieties for Tama-ya, her family's mochi shop. School and growing up, on the other hand, are some things that she's still trying to find the right recipe for. But with the help of her best friends Kanna and Midori, two girls whose parents run businesses in the same shopping district, Tamako's determined to make the best of things. It's complicated though, especially when it comes to emotions and her relationship with her best boy friend Mochizou, whose family runs a rival mochi shop. And lately, Midori's been feeling a little odd about her feelings towards Tamako as well. And what's with up with that strange bird fluttering around, the one that speaks fluent Japanese? It's all very mysterious and overwhelming, but at least Tamako always has one thing she can count on: No matter if your day's been good or bad, there's certain to be something sugary and delicious waiting at the end of every adventure whenever you take a walk through Tamako Market!<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

The Human Galactic Alliance has been constantly fighting for its survival against a grotesque race of beings called \"Hidiaazu.\" During an intense battle, the young lieutenant Ledo and his humanoid mobile weapon Chamber are swallowed up into a distortion of time and space. Waking from his artificially induced hibernation, Ledo realizes that he has arrived on Earth, the planet on the lost frontier. On this planet that was completely flooded by the seas, people live in fleets of giant ships, salvaging relics from the seas' depths in order to survive. Ledo arrives on one of the fleets called Gargantia. With no knowledge of the planet's history or culture, he is forced to live alongside Amy, a 15-year-old girl who serves as a messenger aboard the Gargantia fleet. To Ledo, who has lived a life where he knows nothing but fighting, these days of peace continue to surprise him.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

One of the most powerful espers on the planet, Hyoubu's incredible range of abilities extends as far as controlling his own aging process, and the potential strength of all his talents combined is so terrifying that he wears a device that limits their use except in cases of extreme emergency.  The time is coming, however, when Hyoubu will need to unleash everything he has.
