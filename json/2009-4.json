Some struggle hand-to-mouth in the jungle-tangled ruins of civilization. Some live comfortably within the closed-off city of Atlas. Others lurk online, anonymously hacking the global economy. As nature grows more violent and the divide between classes expands, one spirited girl &ndash; Kuniko &ndash; must face her destiny and lead her people into the utopia of Atlas. The city's ruthless government isn't going to welcome them with open arms, but Kuniko won't give up until the gates of Atlas are kicked open for good &ndash; even if it means discovering that the promised land she dreamed of is built upon a foundation of twisted secrets and lies. <br><br>\n(Source: FUNimation) ",

          "description": "Considered as the third installment in the highly popular \"When They Cry\" series by 07th Expansion, Umineko no Naku Koro ni takes place on the island of Rokkenjima (&#20845;&#36562;&#23798;), owned by the immensely wealthy Ushiromiya family. As customary per year, the entire family is gathering on the island for a conference that discusses the current financial situations of each respective person. Because of the family head's poor health, this year involves the topic of the head of the family&rsquo;s inheritance and how it will be distributed.<br><br>\nHowever, the family is unaware that the distribution of his wealth is the least of Ushiromiya Kinzo's (family head) concerns for this year's family conference. After being told that his end was approaching by his longtime friend and physician, Kinzo is desperate to meet his life's true love one last time: the Golden Witch, Beatrice. Having immersed himself in black magic for many of the later years in his life, Kinzo instigates a ceremony to revive his beloved upon his family's arrival on Rokkenjima. Soon after, a violent typhoon traps the family on the island and a string of mysterious murders commence, forcing the eighteen people on the island to fight for their lives in a deadly struggle between fantasy and reality.<br><br>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to the terraformer, mutations to wildlife and \"stampedes,\" immense earthquakes, have occurred. This led to the giant, wheeled cities. One of the largest past times is a racing competition held on the wheeled cities. The goal is to beat the track records held by Loser King, who disappeared a century ago. Shiro, one of the top racers, is horribly injured by a stampede. As Shiro's condition seems to be hopeless, a mysterious woman walks in and offers him the chance to race again.

Still, you would think he'd know enough to be careful with an ancient relic he finds in the woods, especially when a mysterious goddess appears and tells him to leave it alone.  Unfortunately, despite Mito's best efforts, the seal gets broken anyway and a number of dangerous \"tayuti\" that it held in stasis get loose.  This is bad.
