          "description": "A group called the Shinkansen Ultra Evolution Institute was investigating a recent rash of monster attacks happening in Japan after the appearance of a mysterious Black Shinkansen. The SUEI had a major weapon for the fight - Shinkalions, bullet trains that can transform into giant mecha. One boy, Hayato Hayasugi, was a huge fan of trains and stumbled upon his father’s secret work for the SUEI. Surprisingly, Hayato soon became a Shinkalion driver! As perhaps Japan’s best chance of survival, Hayato and other kids take on the great responsibility of fighting otherworldly enemies. <br> <br>\n\nNow, a new giant enemy has come from space looking to conquer the planet. Although the SUEI have a new prototype Shinkalion known as the ALFA-X to take up the fight, Hayato’s father, Hokuto, disappears. A 9-year-old version of Hokuto leaps through time to the present to help fight the alien attackers and drives the ALFA-X! <br><br>\n\n(Source: Tokyo Otaku Mode)",

The way this town is constructed, is a realization of what human discrimination looks like.\n<br><br>\nSonia is a young, female detective who has just moved from Upper Town to Outside for work, chasing after a few cases.

Belo has dove headfirst into the world of gaming, taking a philosophical view of both humans and the world. With every incident, they come into contact with humans, get hurt, and worry. They fight for the sake of humanity, however, due to their horrible form, they are something that humans will never accept.\n<br><br>\nThere is another who is searching for these three beings.

Now, though, the Z/X and mankind are settling into an uneasy peace and some humans are entering into pacts with the interdimensional newcomers.
