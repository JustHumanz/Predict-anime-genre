In that city, there was an \"unobservable realm\" which had never existed until now.<br><br>\n\nChaldea issued the Grand Order for a \"Holy Grail Expedition,\" to investigate, uncover, and possibly destroy the singularity that apparently will cause the extinction of humanity.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Will the secret be discovered before it’s too late? Will Hestia finally come clean with Bell?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Born into great wealth, she was a princess of the highest pedigree–until she was cut off by the leader of the Akagami Foundation. For the last five years, she's lived on Feather Island with her maids. But she hasn't been alone. She has invited the best minds Japan has to offer to come and stay with her.<br>\n<br>\nAnd so nineteen-year-old college student Ii-chan and his best friend, computer genius Kunagisa Tomo, find themselves as Iria’s guests at her elaborate mansion. Surrounded by fascinating women – a chef, a fortune-teller, a scholar, and an artist, not to mention his own friend Tomo – Ii-chan is feeling a little overmatched intellectually. But the sudden discovery of a grisly murder sends the island into shock. And Ii-chan discovers that he does possess a bit of genius: the ability to discover what is real and what is fake, who is who they claim to be and who is a killer.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Del Rey Manga)",

From the discovery of anti-gravitons came the dream invention of anti-graviton shoes that let people fly the skies. They introduce people to a new realm by enabling flight with just one's own body strength, without feathers or engines. This led to the rise of the sport of \"Flying Circus\".<br>\n<br>\nThe protagonist who once hoped for a future in this sport suffered a setback due to an overwhelming defeat, and withdrew from the sport for this and some other reason. However, he met the transfer student Asuka Kurashina, and in teaching her to fly the skies, the old passion returned. He takes part in the Flying Circus again.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
