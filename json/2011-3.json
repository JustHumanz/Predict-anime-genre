In the midst of this struggle, the prince of the Levamme Empire declares his love for Juana del Moral and vows to end the war in one year, as part of his marriage proposal. When the Amatsukami catch wind of this, they assault the del Moral residence, targeting Juana's life. As a last ditch effort to bring the prince his bride, the San Maltilia Airforce hires a mercenary of mixed blood—a bestado—to fly Juana to the Levamme capital in secret.

That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Card Fights, something that changes his life drastically.<br><br>\nThe name of the card game is \"Vanguard.\" The game takes place in a different planet called \"Cray,\" and due to a never before seen play system, it becomes popular throughout the world.<br><br>\nAichi, immediately attracted by Vanguard, meets friends such as Tokura Misaki and Katsuragi Kamui, along with other rivals. Through friendly rivalry with them, Aichi begins to enjoy a fulfilling life. Aichi, however, has a goal: to once again battle with a Vanguard Fighter by the name of Kai Toshiki. Kai Toshiki is an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities in the world of Vanguard. He is also the reason why Aichi started playing the game.
