No, it&rsquo;s not a game of football, it&rsquo;s Sena Kobayakawa trying to evade the monstrous Ha-Ha brothers down the halls of Deimon High School!  But wait!  Sena&rsquo;s incredible skills at not getting caught have been spotted by the devilish (possibly actually demonic) captain of the school&rsquo;s embryonic American style football team, and when Sena asks to be the teams manager, he gets  thrust onto the field as a running back instead!  But there are two BIG catches: first, to keep the identity of their new &ldquo;star&rdquo; player an absolute secret, Yoichi makes Sena wear an opaque visor on his helmet and gives him the alias of &ldquo;Eyeshield 21.&rdquo;  And the second catch?  Well, in order to hit his fastest &ldquo;speed of light&rdquo; running mode, Sena usually has to be absolutely terrified. Not that THAT will be a problem with the monstrous players that he&rsquo;ll soon find himself running from!  The insanity hits the streets when the feet meet the cleats in EYESHIELD 21! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Because of this she develops a new way of playing that allows her to stay on the thin line between winning and losing, the plus/minus zero score, an almost impossible score.

Upon touching the Go board, Hikaru is possessed by the spirit of Fujiwara no Sai, and continues to be haunted by him soon after. Sai was once a great Go player, who committed suicide and continued to stay in the world as a spirit desiring only to play Go once again. Finally bending to Sai's pleas, Hikaru allows Sai to play Go through himself, unknowingly attempting the first game with the young prodigy Touya Akira. Time has finally started moving, as Sai's quest for the perfect game, \"The Hand of God\", is set underway. Based on the manga by Yumi Hotta and Takeshi Obata.",
