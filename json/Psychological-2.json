Instead they resemble the primeval body of life and are generally known as \"Mushi\". Their existence and appearance are unknown to many and only a limited number of humans are aware of them. Ginko is a \"Mushi-shi\" who travels around to investigate and find out more about the \"Mushi\".

Detective Re-l Meyer begins to investigate, seeking answers to the weird occurrences that are happening more and more around her. But when she begins to uncover the truth, her world is turned upside down.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, the strange immigrant Vincent Law goes missing and then a monster appears before her, shaking her to her core. But this monster is something more, something dangerous and sinister. With each question and mystery, she is led back to the creature. But what is it really? What purpose does it serve?

As they make their way across scarred and deserted Earth, Re-l and Vincent will learn more about the monster and the \"awakening\"-which could be more of an ending than a beginning.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Funimation)",

          "description": "Once you make a decision, does the universe conspire to make it happen? Is destiny a matter of chance, a matter of choice or the complex outcome of thousands of warring strands of fate? All twins Kanba and Shoma know is that when their terminally ill sister Himari collapses at the aquarium, her death is somehow temporarily reversed by the penguin hat that she had asked for. It's a provisional resurrection, however, and it comes at a price: to keep Himari alive they need to find the mysterious Penguin Drum. In order to do that, they must first find the links to a complex interlocking chain of riddles that has wrapped around their entire existence, and unravel the knots that tie them to mystifying diary and a baffling string of strangers and semi-acquaintances who all have their own secrets, agendas and \"survival strategies.\" And in order for Himari to live, someone else's chosen destiny will have to change. It's a story of love, fate, life, death... and Penguins! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",
