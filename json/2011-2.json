Here, time seems to have stopped: old wooden buildings, holy shrines surrounded by trees, fields painstakingly carved out from steep hills... and no shopping mall. <br><br>\nNeedless to say, Momo is not too overenthusiastic about this new environment. Most of all, her heart is still feeling uneasy about an unfinished letter left by her father. A letter that contained only two words: \"Dear Momo...\" <br><br>\nWhat was dad going to say? <br><br>\nOne day, exploring the attic of her new big house, Momo finds a dusty and worn out book.

What's certain is that he's Shinjurou Yuuki, a young man with a passion for mysteries and a talent for solving them that has made him the target of dark forces now stirring within the sinister underworld of a near future Tokyo. That could prove lethal, given that not even the other \"good guys\", including the police, are exactly on Shinjuro's side. Fortunately Yuuki's not completely on his own, and with the aid of his uniquely talented associate Inga, he's ready to cut a swath through the veils of secrecy that have been laid before him. \n<br><br>\nGet ready for mind against matter and a lot of cloak and dagger as the ultimate battle of clue and deduction begins in UN-GO! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
