Ginko is a \"Mushi-shi\" who travels around to investigate and find out more about the \"Mushi\".

Every day he dreamed of being with the mercenary \"Light Finding Operation (LFO)\" aircraft pilot group \"Gekkostate\" and riding \"Trapar\" particle waves —a sport called \"reffing\"— with their charismatic leader Holland, especially when faced with his father's acclaimed past or his grandfather's desire to protect him. When a young girl named Eureka riding the original LFO, the \"Nirvash typeZERO\", asks his grandfather for a tune-up, she inadvertently brings the attention of the military to the garage; as a result, the garage is destroyed and Renton is forced to deliver a new type of interface —the \"Amita Drive\"— to the Nirvash. After a heated fight in which the Nirvash destroys the military LFOs by unleashing an immense amount of power, Renton is invited into Gekkostate. However, he quickly realizes that behind the facade of a traveling group of mercenaries is a very bitter reality. <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network) ",

The city itself is a faithful replication of Manhome's (the planet formerly known as Earth) Venice.<br>\n<br>\nTo make sure that residents and tourists alike get the most from Neo Venezia's many wonders, companies offering guided tours via gondola were formed, one of which is named Aria Company.<br>\n<br>\nThis is the workplace of Akari Mizunashi, a free spirited teenager from Manhome who is now a novice Undine (the title given to tour guides).

          "description": "He had thought his normal days would last forever, until they were ended abruptly by an encounter with a girl with red hair and eyes. He named her Shana.<br><br>\nNot long after he enters high school, Sakai Yuji&rsquo;s normal days come to an end. He sees something bizarre on his way home: people are frozen in a strange fire, and a monster that looks like a large doll is attacking them. Just when he's about to be killed, a girl in a dark cloak wielding a large sword appears, and slices the monster in half. Although Yuji survives the strange encounter, the girl informs him of a desolate truth: \" 'You' don't exist anymore.\"<br><br>\nShe calls herself a Flame Haze who hunts \"Guze no Tomogara\"; intruders from another world. She explains to him that he is a \"Torch\", a substitute of Yuji whose &ldquo;existence&rdquo; has already been devoured. She also told him that he is a special Torch, \"Mystes\", which contains a precious item in it. When he looks at his chest, he sees within himself a faint flame, just as she said.<br><br>\nIt is in this way that his eternal struggle alongside the girl begins. <br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo) ",
