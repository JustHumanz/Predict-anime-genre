          "description": "It's one thing to honor your ancestors and keep old traditions alive, but there IS such a thing as taking it to a ridiculous extreme. In Kawakami City, having a samurai ancestor and enormous 'fighting spirit' isn't just an interesting fact, it's a huge part of how you end up being ranked on the social totem pole. That, in turn, rolls over into the school curriculum. Fortunately, that's something the local kids like Yamato Naoe have learned to deal with by forming into small 'bands,' (that's the samurai type, NOT music). However, while the delicate sexual balance of Yamato's group seemed fine when there were three girls and four boys, the sudden addition of two MORE girls starts to send everything spinning out of control! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Discovering the remnants of an old beach store, the entire group strips to swimsuits and sets out to make the uninhabited island inhabitable, but they're unaware that this seeming paradise is actually just the dead calm before the storm. Because sometimes the recently deceased aren't the only problems that can lie buried in the sand, and as the swimwear comes off and the inhibitions come down, a kink in the island's food chain sets a truly shocking series of events into motion! You won't believe what comes out next, but suffice it to say that the deserted island may not be so deserted after all!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: An unaired episode bundled with the seventh volume of the manga.</i>",

Currently, the annual number of suicides in Japan is said to be more than 30,000 people for the last 10 years. Yes, about ten times the amount of soldiers that died in the Iraq war.<br><br>\nI don't have the power to resolve this problem which Japan holds. But with the power of animation I hope to awake even a few dreams and a little bit of desire in the people that watch it, and that they'll have the courage to live in the future.",
