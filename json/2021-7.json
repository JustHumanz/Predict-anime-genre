Kennedy is among the group invited to the White House to investigate this incident, but when the lights suddenly go out, Leon and the SWAT team are forced to take down a horde of mysterious zombies.\n<br><br>\nMeanwhile, TerraSave staff member Claire Redfield encounters a mysterious image drawn by a youth in a country she visited, while providing support to refugees. Haunted by this drawing, which appears to be of a victim of viral infection, Claire starts her own investigation. The next morning, Claire visits the White House to request the construction of a welfare facility. There, she has a chance reunion with Leon and uses the opportunity to show him the boy's drawing. Leon seems to realize some sort of connection between the zombie outbreak at the White House and the strange drawing, but he tells Claire that there is no relation and leaves.\n<br><br>\nIn time, these two zombie outbreaks in distant countries lead to events that shake the nation to its very core.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Netflix)",

The Toei team's proposal is about an ordinary young man of today who timeleaps into a world where Edo and the near future are fused together and creates his own destiny... and the Sotsu team's proposal is about an idol who travels back in time to the Edo period. As a result, a pilot film on the theme of \"Edo\" and \"Idol\" was produced.<br><br>\n\nThe story of <i>SHAREDOL</i> is set in the Edo period, the Kansei era (1789-1800), a time when entertainment was strictly restricted. Based on the idea of \"What if we used the knowledge of modern idols to produce Edo girls?\" it depicts idol activities of girls living with their own problems. The protagonist produces six girls - a teahouse girl, a samurai girl, a Dutch trading house girl, a merchant girl, an oiran (high-ranking courtesan), and a kunoichi (female ninja), who have lived a different life. <br><br>\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll, edited)",

Remnants of the Meiji era’s culture can be seen around the city, but scientific technology and Japanese esoteric cosmology Onmyodo are also developing, exuding a sense of modernity. Yet lurking behind the glitz is Kuchinawa, a dissident group planning the assassination of the prince, and effectively the fall of the regime. Tasked to extinguish these dissidents is Nue, the government’s secret executioner group. Sawa Yukimura, who works for this organization, suffered from an early age at the hands of the Kuchinawa boss. Her entire family was murdered and she dedicated her life to avenging their death.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)<br><br><i>Note: The show streamed the episodes on Hulu a week earlier than TV.
