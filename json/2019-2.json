          "description": "A seventh Singularity has been discovered in ancient Mesopotamia in the year 2655 B.C.<br>\n<br>\nThe land of Uruk, governed by the wise King Gilgamesh after he returned from his quest for immortality, was grand and prosperous until three goddesses and countless Demonic Beasts appeared. These enemies have brought Uruk to the brink of destruction. With a Rayshift—a method of traveling across both time and space—Fujimaru and Mash journey to the land of Uruk, where they encounter the fortress city of Uruk and the Absolute Demonic Front, where a terrible battle against the fearsome onslaught of the Demonic Beasts rages. There, the citizens of Uruk, who live their lives to the fullest despite facing an existential threat, continue to fight for their future. Deities and Demonic Beasts attack with terrifying force, and mankind pushes back with all its might... This is the era where humans and gods are destined to part ways.<br>\n<br>\nFujimaru and Mash, the pair who have fought through all six previous Singularities, embark on their final battle.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Aniplex of America)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: Based on the Babylonia Singularity of Fate/Grand Order, the Japanese smartphone role-playing game created by Delight Works based on the Fate series by Type-Moon.</i>",

Her wish is for her son's voice to be unrivaled, so that it will be heard by the imperial court. But the intense training results in a tragic accident, where she dies. Left an orphan as a result, Lang wanders the land. His voice is used as a tool by the wicked and greedy, with his heart being ground down in the process. Eventually his strange singing catches the ear of the princess of Xi You, and Lang is elevated to the stage his mother had dreamt of. But what awaits him is a life or death battle performance against other musicians for the amusement of the members of the court. Until one day, Lang learns of the rumors of the Sword Plundering Nemesis, an infamous bandit known through all of Xi You for stealing magical weapons. What he doesn't know is that the  next weapon in the sights of this thief has been hidden by the emperor in the same castle Lang has been performing in.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

At stake – the future of dining across Japan. Because if the rebels fail, Azami intends to impose his own tastes and techniques on the entire restaurant industry!<br>\n<br>\nBut the fine dining control freak has made a serious mistake in threatening the futures of Souma’s friends and family, as while the rebels may seem less experienced overall, this is ultimately a clash of skill, dedication, and, most of all, taste. That may be a recipe for disaster for the seasoned veterans!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

He suggests sumo wrestling as a way for everyone to have fun together, and his friends are immediately on board with the idea. Thus begins Tempest's first sumo tournament, in which everyone competes enthusiastically in hopes of winning the grand prize! Passionate contests break out not only among Benimaru and the men, but also among women like Shuna and Shion, and even Rimuru ends up joining in!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>OVA 2:</strong><br>\nOne day, Shuna and Shion are fighting over Rimuru's squishy slime body as usual. Rimuru figures that giving them each a body double of himself would solve the conflict, but when he imagines some of his other friends asking him to do the same for them, he quickly drops that plan. Then he comes up with the idea to make a cushion in the shape of his slime form. He travels around Tempest to see if his friends know of any good materials he can use, and he learns that a special type of sand found along a lakeshore in the forest is exactly what he's looking for. So he sets out to collect some sand... but a monster is waiting for him by the lake! What's more, Milim hears about his plan for a picnic and comes racing down from the sky!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>OVA 3-5:</strong><br>\nRimuru, now a teacher at the Freedom Academy in the Kingdom of Ingrassia, has become involved in the school's outdoor training event with his class. The outdoor training event is an annual competition in which the students of each class guard the teachers on a journey to a nearby town. Rimuru is assigned to Class A, while his own students in Class S escort the young Tiss-sensei. All the students are eager to show how much their daily training has paid off, but the situation turns around when they're attacked by thieves!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: Bundled with the limited edition of the 12th-16th manga volumes.</i>",
