          "description": "Inspired by a book on Japanese cuisine written by British food writer Michael Booth, this family oriented foodie anime runs the gamut from chanko to yakisoba, and almost everything in between. Booth becomes obsessed with Japanese cuisine after reading about it, so he and his wife and their two young boys travel the length of Japan over three months, devouring everything in their way. If you're curious about okonomiyaki, or fearful of natto, you'll definitely enjoy this fun, light-hearted trans-national food voyage!\n<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Viewster)",

A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both greater and yet also smaller than he ever could imagine.
