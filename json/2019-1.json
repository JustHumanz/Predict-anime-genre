Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified.\n<br><br>\nHowever, Senkuu's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken.

There, they'll experience the everyday travails of being heroes, for the first time without the support of their instructors or chaperons. It's a challenging assignment, but one the plucky students of UA are more than equipped to face – that is, until the arrival of a team of villains lead by the ruthless Nine and his eerily familiar quirk. Cut off from any backup and facing their greatest threat yet, it's up to Deku, Bakugo, and their classmates to face unspeakable danger to protect not only the people of the island, but the future of all Hero society.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Powerful \"Spirits\" from other dimensions that take the form of girls are unintentionally causing these spatial quakes in his reality. And Shidou is the only one who can stop them with his unique ability: kissing them! By having the girls kiss and fall deeply in love with him, their devastating quake powers are sealed. The alternative to romancing them is to have a more militant and technological organization called the AST (Anti-Spirit Team) destroy the Spirits, something Shidou is vehemently against.\n<br><br>\nSo far in the story, six Spirits have fallen for Shidou (as well as a few others). The girls compete with one another and vie for his affection, leaving him no end of headaches and misadventures. But a new challenger approaches.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Tokyo Otaku Mode)",
