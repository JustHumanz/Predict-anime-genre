In order to give his destitute family a better life, his ultimate goal is to obtain the special VIP nomination, a prestigious scholarship covering all future university tuition fees. Although Nariyuki could feasibly be a shoe-in for the nomination, he is constantly overshadowed by classmates Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi in mathematics and literature, respectively.\n<br><br>\nTo his delight, Nariyuki receives the nomination, but there’s a catch: he has to tutor his two star classmates, who are each hopelessly mediocre at the other’s subject of expertise! To make matters worse, the subjects they are horrible at are the same subjects they want to pursue for their future. As the time to submit university applications draws nearer, Nariyuki must find an effective tutoring method for the girls before it’s too late.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Official Website)",

Annoyed at the increased noise level brought on by additional company, Kazuma notices a choker at his feet. After trying it on casually, he runs into big trouble: it's a magical choker designed to make wishes come true, and until his wish does come true, it's going to keep tightening around his neck until he's strangled to death! The others work hard to help make his \"dreams\" come true so that the choker will come loose, with Wiz offering her thighs as pillows, Darkness doing push ups to make her chest sway, and Megumin and Yunyun engaged in strip rock paper scissors... while Aqua runs errands. But will even that be enough to make the choker come off?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

But Chi-Kin's female troubles don't totally redline until a wrong turn in the men's room exposes the secret Subaru, Kanade's manservant, has been hiding in the water closet. (Well, to be fair, we should say WOmanservant.) And if Subaru's cross reactions concerning her cross-dressing aren't enough of a drag, Kinjiro's girl problems also include a haunted martial artist (with ghosts); a cat-eared fetishist (meow!); AND his own sister, whose interest in \"wrestling\" a certain incorrectly packaged butler may result in an unexpected ending!

In the center of the meteor's crater lies Rikka, a system of six academies known as the Asterisk. Ayato Amagiri enters the Asterisk as a transfer student hoping to compete in a special battle event known as the Festa. However, he quickly finds himself on the bad side of one of the strongest fighters around—the beautiful but fiery Julis-Alexa von Riessfeld.

To be clear, none of our lady educational professionals begin their semesters by writing “get involved with a fortunate male member of my class” in their daily planners…  but strange and inexplicable things keep happening to thrust our teacher/pupil combos into sexually charged situations where something’s bound to happen! Whether it’s falling into water, doors ripping off clothing, or that frequent staple of Japanese school life, the accidental breast/face collision, these poor ladies just can’t help it. And what are the guys supposed to do as they’re pulled deeper and deeper into titillating TILF traps of epic proportions?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Powerful \"Spirits\" from other dimensions that take the form of girls are unintentionally causing these spatial quakes in his reality. And Shidou is the only one who can stop them with his unique ability: kissing them! By having the girls kiss and fall deeply in love with him, their devastating quake powers are sealed. The alternative to romancing them is to have a more militant and technological organization called the AST (Anti-Spirit Team) destroy the Spirits, something Shidou is vehemently against.\n<br><br>\nSo far in the story, six Spirits have fallen for Shidou (as well as a few others). The girls compete with one another and vie for his affection, leaving him no end of headaches and misadventures. But a new challenger approaches.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Tokyo Otaku Mode)",

That's a lesson Ryosuke Kaga learns the hard way when he foolishly agrees to let Lisara Restole use some of his \"essence\" to stay in this world. Because despite her smoking hot appearance, Lisara's actually a Shinigami, a Goddess of Death. However, she DOESN'T steal years off his life like any decent Shinigami would do. Oh no, instead she sucks him dry of something much more perverse by leeching off his lecherous spirit and draining his ability to enjoy... er... the things that teenage boys normally spend most of their time thinking about! And now that he's been de-debased and de-debauched by her un-dirty trick, the poor regenerated degenerate's only hope of getting his licentiousness renewed is to join the queen of mental-clean on her quest, since when she leaves our mortal plane he regains his normal immorality! But the termination of the probation of his reprobation isn't guaranteed, because the Goddesses of Death can be really a harsh mistresses and it's going to be anything but easy to go back to being sleazy! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

          "description": "As close encounters of the twisted kind between the residents of the planet Develuke (represented primarily by the female members of the royal family) and the inhabitants of Earth (represented mainly by one very exhausted Rito Yuki) continue to escalate, the situation spirals even further out of control. When junior princesses Nana and Momo transferred into Earth School where big sister LaLa can (theoretically) keep an eye on them, things SHOULD be smooth sailing. But when Momo decides she'd like to \"supplement\" Rito's relationship with LaLa with a little \"sisterly love,\" you know LaLa's not going to waste any time splitting harems. Unfortunately, it's just about that point that Yami, the Golden Darkness, enters the scene with all the subtleness of a supernova, along with an army of possessed high school students! All of which is certain to make Rito's life suck more than a black hole at the family picnic. Unless, of course, a certain semi-demonic princess can apply a little of her Develukean Whoop Ass to exactly that portion of certain other heavenly bodies! <br><br>\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Since Ao thinks that anyone who learns about her father is going to assume that Ao is at least somewhat like her pornographic papa, Ao’s solution is to just not talk to other people, especially boys. All she wants to do is study and get good grades so she can go to a school far away from her family. And that’s why Takumi Kajima is driving her crazy!
