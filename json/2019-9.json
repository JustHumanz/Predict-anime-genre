          "description": "A world where fairies possess and reside within animals, granting them special powers. By surgically removing and transplanting the organs of a possessed animal into a human, humans can partially summon the fairy and use it as a weapon. Eventually, such individuals were used for war, and were called \"Fairy Soldiers.\" After a long war, these soldiers lost their purpose, and had to reintegrate into society. From the government, to the mafia, and even becoming terrorists, each tread their own path.<br><br>\n\nThe story begins nine years after the end of the war, and centers on the protagonist Maria. Maria is a fresh recruit of \"Dorothea,\" an organization dedicated to the investigation and suppression of fairy-related crimes and incidents. Even in peacetime, the government is still unstable after the war. Many criminals still have lingering wounds from the previous conflict, and there are terrorist groups bent on revenge. This is the story of Fairy Soldiers seeking their own justice in a chaotic postwar world.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "Rin Namiki's greatest ambition is to follow in her late mother's footsteps and compete in Kandagawa Jet Racing, where teams of girls on jet skis race while firing high-powered water guns to slow their competitors' jets (and blow off their clothing!). But since there's no jet racing in Rin's remote fishing village, that means moving, all by herself, to a girls' school in faraway Tokyo!<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, Misa Aoi dreamed of becoming a great player, but those ambitions floundered until Rin transferred to her school, displaying astonishing skill for a newcomer. Is it fate? Now they \"only\" have to resurrect their school's Jet Riding Club, endure brutal training, and face some seriously skilled rivals… but even the toughest tasks are easier when you're doing something you love with someone who's quickly becoming far more than just a friend!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Their proof of being a Saint laid with the battle protector known as Sacred Cloth.<br>\n<br>\nAfter a virtual eternity, a new struggle is about to unfold now again over the Cloth. A boy named Seiya has crossed way over to Greece to undergo the training to become a Saint and obtained the Cloth, Bronze cloth, the lowest position among Saints. Every Saint takes a constellation as their tutelary god. And Seiya's guardian star is Pegasus. Now, the saints gather together from all over the world to participate in the \"Galatic War\" - championship of Saints, aiming at the Gold Cloth, the symbol of ruler of the Saints. The curtain for Galatic War has been cut open. During the death battle between the Saints, Phoenix, the Black Saint, suddenly appeared on the scene and runs off with Gold Cloth in front of a full house in his ambition to become ruler of the world. Seiya and his fellow bronze cloth warriors go after Phoenix and his \"Shadow Army\" to retrieve the lost Gold Cloth...<br>\n<br>\nThe battles waged among the saints, the strongest young men on earth, begin now!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Toei Animation)",
