On a typical day of walking to work with a hollow look on his face, he suddenly found himself in the forest of another world. \"Oh, this must be one of those isekai reincarnations people keep talking about.\" The two skills he has are \"Appraise\" and \"Drug Discovery.\" Those don't sound too impressive... well, whatever. Except these turn out to be particularly overpowered skills! He's able to produce the healing medicines that were sorely lacking in the world, one after another, leading to an overnight fortune. No one will ever force him to work like a slave again! He decides to adopt a deliberately slow life, and opens a drug store. And so, a story about following the slow life philosophy while running a drugstore in another world begins.<br><br>(Source: Crunchyroll)",

Each envoy has its own strengths and vulnerabilities. They compete and support each other as they draw closer to their destination, facing treacherous terrain and difficult conditions. Through athletic challenges and the uniting power of sport, they discover the positive fundamental values that come with playful competition.\nTogether, the envoys approach near the source of the message leaf.\nCan they restore life to a future in peril? <br>\n<br>\n(Source: International Olympic Committee) <br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: Premiered early on June 14, 2021 at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, ahead of the cultural programme at Tokyo 2020.
