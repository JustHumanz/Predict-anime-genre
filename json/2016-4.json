Or, on the other end of the spectrum, you may be left only leftovers. In this type of battlefield atmosphere, students are always doing their best to “evolve” and survive. “Learning Types” are students who have studied hard their whole lives and legitimately memorized everything they have studied, while “Cheating types” are those who, as the name suggests, only managed to climb the educational ladder by cheating. Though sometimes they must cooperate with each other, there is a great rivalry between the two types. How will the hero “Mumei”, a C Type, followed by the heroin “Koi” a L-Type, struggle in those tests. Now a new battle, one beyond imagination, is about to begin.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Emon)",

Remembering how she loved making board games when she was little, Tamaki takes the plunge and joins the group as their new artist.<br>\n<br>\nNow she, programmer Shiina, writer Ayame and composer Kayo are in a frantic race to finish their game in time to show at the big \"doujin\" conventions. Meeting their deadlines won't be easy, especially since Tamaki has to learn on the job and Aya keeps getting distracted writing steamy love scenes. But where there's a will there's a way, and with the help of a bunch of talented friends, they just might be able to make it in time!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
