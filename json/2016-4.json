Galko is a slightly foul-mouthed but good-natured girl who is popular in her class. Her hobby is film appreciation. Otako is a girl who sits in the corner of the classroom, but for some reason is good friends with Galko. Ojou is an airheaded girl who often talks with Galko and Otako.<br>\n<br>\nEach of the girls' names refers to their type. Galko is a pun on gyaru or gal, which is a term used to describe a type of street fashion where women in their teens and 20s bleach their hair and wear highly decorated nails and a lot of makeup. Otako is a pun on otaku, and Ojou refers to a girl who is a daughter of a high-class family.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

What if all the superhumans ever written about in fictional stories existed at the same time? Superhumans who came into existence through different circumstances, and who are special in different ways -- Titans from outer space, lifeforms from a mystical world, phantoms and goblins from ancient times, cyborgs created by scientists, relics that rose out of the ruins of ancient civilizations, and the list goes on. One segment of these superhumans makes no secret of their existence and has gained popularity in society. Others cloak their identities and fight in secrecy.<br>\n<br>\nThere are enemies of superhumans as well, organizations that operate in the shadows.<br>\n<br>\nThe Japanese government has taken many measures to secure peace and order.<br>\n<br>\nOne is the establishment of an organization under the Ministry of Health and Welfare -- the Overpopulation Research Laboratory, a.k.a. the Superhuman Bureau.<br>\n<br>\nTheir mission is to identify and approach superhumans, then oversee and safeguard them. One member of the Superhuman Bureau, Jiro Hitoyoshi, is protagonist of this series.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Official Site)",

Tanmoku Ki appears and asks You Keika to make a “pact” with him to fight Evil Spirits together.

The humanity survival and security organization Chaldea was established to observe the world that can only be seen by magic and the world that can only be measured by science — as well as to prevent the final extinction of mankind.<br><br>\n\nThanks to the efforts of many researchers, the path of human history has been ensured for 100 years into the future. However, without warning, the realm of the future that was under constant observation by Chaldea vanished. The extinction of humanity in 2017 was observed — no, confirmed.<br><br>\n\nThe apparent cause of the extinction was in the Japanese city of Fuyuki in 2004. In that city, there was an \"unobservable realm\" which had never existed until now.<br><br>\n\nChaldea issued the Grand Order for a \"Holy Grail Expedition,\" to investigate, uncover, and possibly destroy the singularity that apparently will cause the extinction of humanity.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
