When she stops at a cafe to ask for directions, however, it turns out that she's already where she needs to be! You see, the Rabbit House is both a restaurant and a boarding house, and Cocoa will be working there along with the owner's granddaughter, Chino and the strangely military-obsessed Rize. It's a great place to work, business is hopping, and Cocoa's fits right in with her new coworkers, as well as the girls from two other rival cafes. Still, there is something just a little odd about the Rabbit House. Besides the fact that Rize usually carries a Glock and a knife hidden on her, there's also a mystery involving the shop's pet rabbit, Tippy. And then there are those girls who sometimes seem to be able to communicate without talking…<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

So, since everyone knows that long distance relationships won't work unless the parties involved put extra effort into it, they decide they need to do something extra special to permanently seal their friendship.

Which means that, instead of getting a break after saving the world, newly changed magical girls Illya and Miyu have to help deal with the side-effects caused by the sealing of the Ley Cards. Still, that shouldn't be too hard, right? Wrong! Not only are the ley lines failing, but to make matters worse, Illya somehow ends up with a magical clone… and that sinister clone has plans of her own! Worse yet, since the \"dark\" version of herself is drawing its power from the same source as our heroine, Illya's own powers are being reduced proportionately. These are definitely not the kind of problems that the average girl should have to deal with.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
