          "description": "The appearance of the giant living creatures “Kaiju's” and the ultimate existence that destroys all monsters, Godzilla, has incited a battle that lasted for half a century. Humanity has experienced continuous defeat, and finally plans to escape from the Earth. In 2048, only those who were selected by the A.I. managed under the central government boarded the inter-sidereal emigrant spaceship “Aratrum” to head for “Tau Cetus e”, the planet beyond the distance of 11.9 light-year. However, the environmental condition differences between that of the Earth and Tau e were considered to be inhabitable by human beings.<br><br>\n\nThe young man on the emigrant ship: Haruo, who saw his parents killed by Godzilla in front of his eyes, had only one thing in his mind for 20 years: to return to the Earth and defeat Godzilla. Shut out from the possibility of emigration, as the living environment in the ship deteriorates, the group of “Earth Returnists” led by Haruo are determined to return through a dangerous long-distance hyperspace navigation. However, 20,000 years have passed on Earth since and it has become an unknown world with the ecosystem reigned by Godzilla.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Official Website, edited)",

The citizens of the remote continent of Yggd once thought that there was nothing beyond their continent. The continent was divided into several regions, each with its own king. Though there were small skirmishes amongst them, a lord, chosen by the kings in conference, always maintained balance, until the evil Black Army arrived. The Volunteer Army, led by Yuri, was no match for the Black Army. During the fighting, the Lord of Black captures half of the Chain Chronicle, as well as the capital.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Both of her parents' faces were unknown to her. In front of this heroine, a young boy appeared. The young boy's name was \"Hikaru\". It appeared that he was the heroine's twin brother, separated at birth. He had a proposal for the heroine.<br><br>\n\n\"Could you go to school in my place?\"<br><br>\n\nThe heroine was shocked by this crazy suggestion. Furthermore this was an all-boys school. The only high school in this prefecture for delinquents. Hikaru was part of the most ancient and honorable family in the criminal underworld (yakuza), the Onigashima family. Under his father's strict teachings, the school that he was to attend had been decided. And that school was Shishiku Academy. A high school where all the terrible and wild delinquents were gathered. Enrolled in this school, a child of the Onigashima family was obligated to occupy and control this school. Hikaru did not want to have anything to do with delinquents. But to defy his father meant death. Hikaru, who learnt about his twin sister who was separated from him at birth, was struck with the idea to send her in his place to this school of delinquents.<br><br>\n\n(Source: VNDB)",
