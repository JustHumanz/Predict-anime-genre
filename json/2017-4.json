Instead, he composes music all day, uploading it to the internet for a few views. One day out of the clear blue, he gets an email from what sounds like an older, distinguished gentleman who wants to discuss music face-to-face. Having no one to speak to about his passion, Kyo accepts the invitiation... only to find himself facing down three elementary school girls! They're fans of his music, and they want his help to hold a concert at their orphanage. The girls prove to be good musicians in their own right and have excellent equipment, but is Kyo a good enough producer?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",

Both of her parents' faces were unknown to her. In front of this heroine, a young boy appeared. The young boy's name was \"Hikaru\". It appeared that he was the heroine's twin brother, separated at birth. He had a proposal for the heroine.<br><br>\n\n\"Could you go to school in my place?\"<br><br>\n\nThe heroine was shocked by this crazy suggestion. Furthermore this was an all-boys school. The only high school in this prefecture for delinquents. Hikaru was part of the most ancient and honorable family in the criminal underworld (yakuza), the Onigashima family. Under his father's strict teachings, the school that he was to attend had been decided. And that school was Shishiku Academy. A high school where all the terrible and wild delinquents were gathered. Enrolled in this school, a child of the Onigashima family was obligated to occupy and control this school. Hikaru did not want to have anything to do with delinquents. But to defy his father meant death. Hikaru, who learnt about his twin sister who was separated from him at birth, was struck with the idea to send her in his place to this school of delinquents.<br><br>\n\n(Source: VNDB)",

Humanity has experienced continuous defeat, and finally plans to escape from the Earth. In 2048, only those who were selected by the A.I. managed under the central government boarded the inter-sidereal emigrant spaceship “Aratrum” to head for “Tau Cetus e”, the planet beyond the distance of 11.9 light-year. However, the environmental condition differences between that of the Earth and Tau e were considered to be inhabitable by human beings.<br><br>\n\nThe young man on the emigrant ship: Haruo, who saw his parents killed by Godzilla in front of his eyes, had only one thing in his mind for 20 years: to return to the Earth and defeat Godzilla. Shut out from the possibility of emigration, as the living environment in the ship deteriorates, the group of “Earth Returnists” led by Haruo are determined to return through a dangerous long-distance hyperspace navigation. However, 20,000 years have passed on Earth since and it has become an unknown world with the ecosystem reigned by Godzilla.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Official Website, edited)",

Although her high school life is relatively unremarkable, her career as a member of the military organization S.O.N.G. is anything but. Using powerful, ancient armor known as Symphogear, Hibiki and her teammates work with the United Nations to deal with international disputes and disasters.<br>\n<br>\nDuring a mission briefing at headquarters, Hibiki is made aware of a mysterious organization known as the Bavarian Illuminati, who has been responsible for several major disasters in the past and currently operate in the war-torn country Val Verde. Together, Hibiki and her team infiltrate one of the Bavarian Illuminati's manufacturing plants and free hundreds of slaves. Exposed, alchemists Saint-Germain, Cagliostro, and Prelati reveal themselves as the organization's top brass, and—using alchemical powers—declare a global revolution while sacrificing thousands of lives. Faced with yet another threat to the world's survival, Hibiki and her allies must confront the Bavarian Illuminati in their most difficult and destructive battle yet.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

          "description": "This fender and genre-bending film takes us into the not-too-distant machine-driven future. Kokone should be diligently studying for her university entrance exams, but she just can't seem to stay awake. Aside from stealing precious study time, her napping is even more distracting, as it brings on strange dreams with warring machines that hint at family secrets that have been dormant for years. She can't ask her father, a hipster mechanic more talented and artful than his job requires, as he's always busy modifying motorcycles and cars in flights of fancy. What are these visions that lead Kokone at once closer to and farther away from her family? Like all the best anime, the film revels in multilayered fantasy to show how sometimes opposites—waking and dreaming, the past and the future—are far more intertwined than they appear.<br><br>\n\n(Source: New York International Children's Film Festival)",

For as long as he can remember he's had a voice in his head, but other than that he's a normal boy - right until the day when a strangely-looking thing follows him home and teleports him to a place filled with more fantastic creatures. It's a space police station, and Rein Brickke, the Chief of Solar System Department, tells him that he's been chosen by the computer as a possible candidate to join the police force, although Misuzu Sonokata, a girl from Chuuta's school with an angelic face and ill temper who turns out to be one of Rein Brickke's subordinates, doesn't think him suitable for such a job. Chuuta, who was shocked at first, decides to take aptitude test after being urged by the voice in his head and to prove Misuzu wrong.\n",
