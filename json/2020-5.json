In order to save the Healing Garden, Latte escaped to the human world alongside three \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals, on a mission to find three people who can partner with them. After they meet Nodoka, Chiyu and Hinata, Latte pleaded them to fight for the Healing Garden as they became Pretty Cures in order to fight against the threat of the Bjögens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden. <br><br>(Source: Wikipedia)",

As the brief still-partially human phase is the best time to strike, however, exterminators soon learn to distance themselves, socially and emotionally, from normal people. But when Kidou finds himself suddenly tasked with returning a young survivor to her mother, he starts to realize that his emotions and humanity may not be buried as deeply as he believed!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

But what humans don't know is that on the other side of the Network is the Digital World, a realm of light and darkness. Nor are they aware of the Digimon who live there.<br>\n<br>\nWidespread Network difficulties arise, centered around the Tokyo area. Traffic signals blink chaotically, public outdoor TVs display garbled text, and so on. The news reports it as a case of cyberterrorism.<br>\n<br>\nFifth grader Taichi Yagami stayed home by himself to get ready for a weekend summer camp, but his mother and little sister Hikari went to Shibuya, and now they're aboard a runaway train. Taichi Hurries to Shibuya to save his mother and sister, but the instant he heads toward the station platform... a strange phenomenon befalls the DigiDestined, and Taichi goes to the Digital World! The DigiDestined meet their partner Digimon, and they're faced with an adventure into the unknown...!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: FUJI TELEVISION NETWORK, INC.)",
