          "description": "In 1925 Paul Rusch, an American missionary, arrived in Japan to help The Young Men's Christian Association with reconstruction efforts after the Great Kantou earthquake. Through his association with the Anglican Church he also became a professor at Rikkyo University in Tokyo and deepened his attachement to Japan as a result of conversations with his students. However, he had to leave the country when the Pacific War broke out.\n\nIn 1945 Paul came to Japan again as an officer of General Headquarters and grieved over the deaths of many of his former students. He vowed to dedicate the rest of his life to helping the people living in Kiyosato - a highland area in Yamanashi Prefecture. He raised funds in the United States, helped build various facilities for the population and established the first highland dairy farm in Japan. However, not all Japanese were happy to deal with an American after the war ended, and so emerged one more important task for Paul: to help soothe post-WWII relationships between the people of two countries.\n<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",
