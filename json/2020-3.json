She and her childhood friend Arata and best friend Madoka spend their after-school days in Ikebukuro hanging out.<br>\n<br>\nOne day, though, Madoka tells Mio that she’s in love with Arata, and Mio realizes that she loves Arata, too. But she’s scared of the trio’s relationship falling apart and lies and says that she’ll help them. Mio doesn’t know what to do, so she deliberately acts coldly to Arata, and the two of them get into a fight. Mio soon realizes that all she’s doing is running from her feelings and decides to work things out with Arata and makeup with him. She heads to meet him in the rain but gets into a car accident.<br>\n<br>\nWhen she wakes up, she finds herself in a mysterious world. Trains are running on the water, and beside them, beautiful whales are swimming. It’s a place she’s never seen before. When her train gets to the station, and she leaves the turnstiles, she finds herself in the Ikebukuro she knows so well! But something’s different.<br>\n<br>\nAs she nervously wanders around the city, she meets GiMON, who calls himself this world’s guide. GiMON says that she’s at the \"World Border\" and tries to get her to open a door that he says will lead her to any world she wants to go to.<br>\n <br>\nA mysterious girl called Kiku stops her, and she tells her that the real exit from the World Border is a place called the Forgotten Things Counter. When she gets there, she’ll have to share with it a treasured lost memory and her strong desire to return home.<br>\n <br>\nTogether with GiMON and Kiku, she finds the Forgotten Things Counter, but for some reason, she doesn’t know what her treasured memory is. When she can’t answer, the two of them disappear.<br>\n<br>\nLeft alone in an empty Ikebukuro, she’s forced to search for the lost thing she treasures in a city now overflowing with memories...<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

Unable to return home as the relevant spell was not included in the summoning grimoire, Jashin-chan resorts to violence to liberate herself from her earthly shackles.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, this is easier said than done, as Yurine is no weakling herself. She in fact possesses formidable physical power and uses it to massacre Jashin-chan in a variety of ways, be it shoving her arm in a blender, spreading her intestines across the room or even cooking her. Though these actions would be fatal to anyone without the ability to regenerate, Jashin-chan isn't exactly undeserving of this treatment. Stuck with each other, Yurine lets Jashin-chan live with her in exchange for work around the apartment, and this cohabitation results in situations where, more often than not, Jashin-chan ends up in pieces.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: All episodes premiered on Amazon Prime Video Japan and Crunchyroll on April 6th, 2020.
