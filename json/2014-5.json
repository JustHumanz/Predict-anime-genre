With Sinon's help, Kirito decides to enter the \"Bullet of Bullets,\" a large tournament to choose the most powerful gunner within the realm of GGO, in hopes to become the target of the \"Death Gun\" and make direct contact with the mysterious avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

One day he finds a book in the library about how to summon witches. He tries it as a joke, but it turns out to be the real thing. An apprentice witch named Rurumo appears to grant him a wish. Shibaki helps Rurumo and she in return refuses to take his soul. (This part of this story happened before the start of chapter1) When the story starts, Shibaki wishes he could see Rurumo again. His wishes is granted immediately as Rurumo falls from the sky and crash lands in front of him. He finds out that as punishment for not taking his soul she's been busted down to an apprentice demon. Now, she must complete the task of getting Shibaki to use up 666 magic tickets that grant wishes before she can become a witch again. However, what she doesn't know is that each time he uses a ticket it shortens his life. When the last ticket is used up, Shibaki will die. Shibaki knows this because Rurumo's familiar black cat Chiro tell him as part of the \"contract\" for giving him the tickets. Now, Shibaki has a choice, make a wish and help Rurumo become a witch again or resist the temptation and try to save his own life.\r\n\r\n(Source: jCafe24)",

However, while she knew that there would be changes in the town, she's still unprepared for what she finds upon her return: A giant saucer hovers over the entire city, as it has since shortly after she and her family left. Stranger yet, a girl she doesn't know, Noel, is waiting for her, claiming that they have met before.
