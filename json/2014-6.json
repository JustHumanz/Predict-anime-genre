With the construction of a new school building, there will be one last General Club Festival at the old building that is slated to be closed. The students vow to go all out to make this final cultural festival a success.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Astronomy Club of the protagonist Sou Akiyama is filled with the big names on campus. Just before the festival on October 1, the club receives a request from the student executive committee to calm the uneasiness among the students. There are reports of ghost sightings, accidents, sleeping sickness, and other mysterious incidents at the old building. When Yui Furukawa, a quiet girl who transfered late into the school, appears before Sou, the gears of fate slowly begin to move.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

But after opening the capsule that came out, a ghostly creature named Whisper materialises. Whisper, who was sealed inside the capsule, rewards his liberator Keita by becoming his Yo-kai butler and gives him a Yo-kai Watch. Whoever wears the watch gains the ability to see supernatural creatures called Yo-kai, each type possessing different kinds of magical abilities, and which are normally invisible to humans. The Yo-kai Watch also allows the wearer to summon any Yo-kai they have befriended, enabling the wearer to make use of the Yo-kai's powers. Using it, Keita and Whisper encounter many mischievous Yo-kai around town, resolving the trouble they're causing and befriending many at the same time.\n",

Unfortunately, it was broken and did not move. <br>\nMisaki finds out that this watch originally belonged to her grandfather. It was her grandfather who gave it to her father. They both worked at the Tokyo Station.<br>\nMisaki's father was always strict and severe, especially to her. That was the only memory she would remember about him. She regrets how they could not connect with each other because she could not communicate with him very well when she was in her teens. <br>\nMisaki visits the Tokyo station, hoping to repair this memorable watch. However, the repair shop was already gone. <br>\nShe drops her shoulders and walks on the platform of the station. Suddenly, she finds a station employee who looks just like her father. <br>\nShe runs and follows this person without even thinking...<br>\n<br>\n(Source: YouTube)",
