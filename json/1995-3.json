As \"Extars,\" the Etiquette Club members fight to eliminate evil from the world, which means the bizarre schemes of Sayaka, the nasty, super-rich president of the rival Debutante Club, and her flunky, Todo. <br><br>\r\nThe series was created to promote a line of robot toys from Tomy, and viewers who are willing to accept high school girls' quarrels escalating into battles involving satellite weaponry may enjoy these silly adventures.<br><br>\r\n(Source: AniDB)",

But the boy was shocked to hear that his father picked it up in front of the house of a girl called Yuki\nThe boy decided to return it to her.\n<br><br>\nNext morning, he ran in the snow to a village and saw many boys and girls singing cheerfully. When he came to a small house, he saw a girl sitting alone on the veranda. She said, \"I am Yuki. Who are you?\" He handed a ball to her without an answer. She was very glad and said \" I was looking for it. My sickly mother made this for me. Thank you very much.\" That gave him relief and they become friends.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Kyowa Film)",

Although this collection contains mainly academic studies, it also includes records of insect observation that lead to literary conclusions with mysterious or mythical imagery. The five essays are done in different animation techniques, and each episode is followed by a scene with the boy Tezuka Osamu and a swallow-tailed butterfly called \"Oomurasaki.\" The film depicts the boy Tezuka Osamu desperately chasing Oomurasaki with his butterfly net, together with what he saw in his dreams. This work was screened at the show \"Tezuka Osamu: Images of the Past and Future\". <br><br>\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",
