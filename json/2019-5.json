However, no matter how diverse many of the previous installments have been, you're almost certainly not going to be prepared for the non-stop surreal silliness and fever dream alternative concepts unleashed in this demented new OVA installment. From a surreal talk show where a berserker hostess puts her hapless assassin brother co-host through an increasingly grueling wringer, to spicy ramen endurance tests, magical girls gone wild and wholesale gender-swapping for no apparent reason, you've never seen anything like this!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Each group consisted of seven members and one guide. The guide carried small tubes of poison on their necks to allow them to end their lives if their situation became unbearable. The Japanese government prepared seven \"Fuji\" as refuges for the groups.
