Although it seems that he may not be destined for great things in life as his mother wishes, McDull never gives up.<br><br>\nThe story focuses on several tales about McDull and his childhood. This is told as a narrative reflection of a now adult McDull. These tales muddle up in imaginative uses of Cantonese and heaps of local Hong Kong culture. From tales about a turkey dinner to dreams of following in Lee Lai-shan's footsteps, McDull faces ebbs and flows with his demanding but devoted mother.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
